title: Load Input Datsets
---

The **Load Input Datasets** tool should be run after creating a new GNAT Riverscapes
project with the [Create New GNAT Project](Project_LoadNetwork).  The input stream network and network topology
table are datasets generated by the tools in [Step 1 - Stream Network Preparation](Stream-Network-Prep).
The input dataset names and filepaths will be stored in the project.rs.xml file for future
reference.

## Usage

### Input Parameters

![load_network_example]({{site.baseurl}}assets/images/load_network_form.PNG)

**Input stream network feature class**

* A polyline feature class representing the initial state of the stream network, prior to any
manual editing, spatial and/or attribute queries. This feature class is produced by the
[Build Network Topology Table](Build-Network-Topology-Table) tool.

**Network topology table** (optional)

* A table (typically named *StreamNetworkTable.dbf*) that is produced by the [Build
Network Topology Table](Build-Network-Topology-Table) tool, found in *Step 1 - Stream Network Preparation*.

### Riverscapes Project Management

**GNAT Project XML** (optional)

* THe XML file (*project.rs.xml*) which stores information on the associated Riverscapes project.
