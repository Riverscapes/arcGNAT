The **Geomorphic Network and Analysis Toolbox (GNAT)** is a set of ArcGIS geoprocessing scripts used to generate 
geomorphic attributes for a spatially-explicit stream network dataset, and is designed specifically to work with the
[USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)](https://nhd.usgs.gov).  GNAT is written in Python as an 
ArcGIS Python Toolbox for ArcGIS version 10.4 or higher. GNAT partially relies on third-party libraries, including 
[GDAL](https://gdal.org) and the [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.11/) Python library.

GNAT was originally developed to support the geomorphic attribute analysis and modeling efforts of the Integrated
 Status and Effectiveness Monitoring Program ([ISEMP](http://isemp.org)) and Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program 
 ([CHaMP](https://www.champmonitoring.org)). However, the tools found within GNAT are flexible enough to be used in 
 a wide variety of data processing and analysis efforts revolving around stream networks, such as:

* Stream network preparation
* Attribute management
* Segmentation of stream networks
* Modeling geomorphic attributes


###  Support

GNAT is actively developed and maintained by [South Fork Research, Inc](http://southforkresearch.org).
