The **Geomorphic Network and Analysis Toolbox (GNAT)** is a set of ArcGIS geoprocessing scripts used to generate geomorphic attributes for a spatially-explicit stream network dataset, such as NHD or NWI.  Specifically, it is written in Python as an ArcGIS Python Toolbox for ArcGIS 10.1. Currently, [efforts](https://github.com/SouthForkResearch/pyGNAT) are underway to move GNAT to use open source resources exclusively.

arcGNAT was originally developed to support the geomorphic attribute analysis and modeling efforts of the Integrated Status and Effectiveness Monitoring Program ([ISEMP](http://isemp.org)) and Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program ([CHaMP](https://www.champmonitoring.org)). However, the tools found within GNAT are flexible enough to be used in a wide variety of data processing and analysis efforts revolving around stream networks, such as:

* Stream network preparation
* Attribute management
* Segmentation of stream networks
* Model geomorphic attributes


###  Support

GNAT is developed and maintained by [South Fork Research, Inc](http://southforkresearch.org).
