## Welcome to the Geomorphic Network and Analysis Toolbox (GNAT) wiki!

# What is GNAT?
The Geomorphic Network and Analysis Toolbox (GNAT) is a set of ArcGIS geoprocessing scripts used to generate geomorphic attributes for a spatially-explicit stream network dataset, such as NHD or NWI.  Specifically, it is written in Python as an ArcGIS Python Toolbox for ArcGIS 10.1. Currently, efforts are underway to move GNAT to using open source resources exclusively.

# What is GNAT for?
GNAT was originally developed to support the geomorphic attribute analysis and modeling efforts of the Integrated Status and Effectiveness Monitoring Program ([ISEMP](http://isemp.org)) and Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program ([CHaMP](https://www.champmonitoring.org)). However, the tools found within GNAT are flexible enough to be used in a wide variety of data processing and analysis efforts revolving around stream networks.

# What can GNAT do?
* Stream network preparation
* Attribute management
* Segmentation of stream networks
* Model geomorphic attributes 

GNAT is developed and maintained by [South Fork Research, Inc](http://southforkresearch.org).
